# SQL - Rockbuster Video Rentals
Rockbuster is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing Stiff competition from Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster management team is planning to use its existing movie licensese to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.  

I am taking the part of a data analyst by Rockbuster's business intelligence department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. Using SQL to analyze the data and answer any business questions that other departments may have.  

## Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers taht they can use for their 2020 company strategy.  Here are the main questions they'd like to answer:
  - Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
  - What was the average rental duration for all videos?
  - Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
  - Where are customers with a high lifetime value based in?
  - Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data & Tools
Rockbuster relational database management system and Postgre SQL was used for the analysis purpose.  The data set includes information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, payments, stores, staff, films, actors, rental history, and addresses.
